algorithmic bias, continuing on Jeong's previous work, linked here: Fairness in Education

        <h3 class="skill-header">Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (2020 - 2023)</h3>
        <p class = "skill-para">I have had experience working on 2 projects at LLNL.

First is the CAAS application, where I:

‚Ä¢ Assisted the team at SmartIT with the conversion process of the CAAS application from AngularJS framework l to the newest update Angular 2+, which is a complete rewrite of AngularJS that has been written with more optimization / features for web development. 

‚Ä¢ Added a new ChangeLogs page, which used a database to query and write information on past versions, features/bugfixes, and release dates of CAAS from and display this in the web page to help users keep track of updates.

‚Ä¢ Used Entity Frameworks to create visual representations of views/models of databases, API calls and services, front-end, web api and backend development to make updates to the application 

‚Ä¢ Downgraded converted pages so that it can work simultaneously with the rest of the application to temporarily form a hybrid application of both frameworks

I also worked on the ACE application, gaining more experience building a web application using Amazon Web Services (AWS) such as Lambda, DynamoDB, and SNS that ensures lab-owned accounts are following the proper guidelines for compliance where I:

‚Ä¢ Created a lambda function which cleans up database records and optimized website performance by using AWS Cloudwatch and Lambda, achieving a 25% reduction in latency when the website loads

‚Ä¢ Worked with SAM (Serverless Application Model) applications to streamline the deployment of AWS pipelines, and programmed data ingestors which received payloads from SQS, and wrote them to DynamoDB as a way to record remediation status.

        <p class = "skill-para">  AWARE, or Apple Watch Alcohol Risk Estimator, is a dual platform app, for iPhone and paired Apple Watch users, which aims to mitigate alcohol overdose and overconsumption risks through real-time user analysis and incorporation of several safety features based on a user's predicted intoxication level. 

The app incorporates a Machine Learning model to make real-time predictions on intoxication level based on a user's biometric data including walking steadiness and heart rate, which has never been done before in any existing solution. 

The app then takes several automatic actions based on the level predicted including notifying emergency services in case of a Level 3 (Severe) determination, as well as notifying / texting location to emergency contacts and enabling ride share services (using Uber API) to the user's current location in case of a Level 2 (Drunk) determination. 

The CS Capstone Project culminated in our work being presented in front of a panel of judges at the annual CS Summit (2024) where our team placed 2nd overall and received a cash prize of $1500.

I gained experience by helping create the lab's first fully cloud based web app from scratch and utilizing cloud computing features from AWS (Amazon Web Services) such as Lambda, DynamoDB, and SNS. 

Some of my contributions include creating an AWS Lambda function which cleans up database records automatically at specified intervals and upon detecting changes, creating SAM (Serverless Application Model) applications to deploy AWS pipelines, programming a data ingestor which received payloads from SQS and writing them to DynamoDB as a way to record remediation status, and optimizing website performance by using AWS Cloudwatch and Lambda for an improved user experience.

        <p class = "skill-para">The CAAS (Classified Account Authorization Service) application involves managing classified accesses and handling requests for elevated privileges for government employees, interfacing between various hierarchical levels for employees to request permissions. 

I incorporated skillsets in the Angular CLI as well as Azure DevOps and DynamoDB to add new features including a Changelogs Page which automatically queries the database for new additions for bugfixes and updates and automatically updates the web server, as well as working on a team to help systematically upgrade the entire application from AngularJS to Angular2+ through hybridization and functionality changes. 

I also gained experience with using Entity Frameworks for creating visual representations of views/models of databases, API calls and services, front-end, web api and backend development to make updates to the application, and optimized and updated the application so that new features from the updated framework could be leveraged to make development more efficient within the CAAS application.
